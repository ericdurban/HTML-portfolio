<h1>The Best Movies According to Eric</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime movie. The music always brings me back to the feelings when I 
    first watched it. The story is well written and immerses you into a beautiful, creative world.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I love movies made by Christopher Nolan. This is the peak of what I feel his movies strive to
    achieve; cinematic wonder and character-driven narrative.</p>
<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>
<p>This is one of my new favorite movies. I love it for how original, wacky, and over the top it is.</p>
